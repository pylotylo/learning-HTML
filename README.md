# learning-HTML
________________________________________
12/23/2019 Gaining confidence with html,
having some issues running JS sketches
in html docs. trying to go back to basics 
and start with simple JS functions. maybe 
im missing something, probably, im an idiot.

In the photography catelogue project, I've 
been using what I learned from the html 
and css tutorials on traversy media. I 
may start a separate repository for that
at some point. 

Photography Catelogue Project:

I'd like to create a program that assigns 
keywords and phrases to images (is this uhhh
... metadata??) , and creates essentially a 
database where images can be searched for 
by keyword as opposed to file name. 

My mom was actually the one who suggested
this idea, she'd like a way to bookkeep 
images for reference and lesson plans at
her job as an art teacher. 

Something like this would be useful to me 
as well, to categorize my on photos for
painting reference.

This will probably require some more advanced
serverside processing, looking into PHP for 
now, although the periodic table program is 
my priority for the next couple weeks.

So for now I'm using this as a way to become 
more familiar with the capabilities of html.
